## PokeCard
PokeCard is a simple web application that allows users to search for and view information about their favorite Pokémon. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and uses the PokéAPI to retrieve information about Pokémon.

## Getting Started
To run PokeCard locally, simply clone or download the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. The application should load and you should be able to start searching for Pokémon right away.

## Usage
To search for a Pokémon, simply enter the name or ID number of the Pokémon in the search bar and hit "Enter" or click the "Search" button. If the Pokémon is found, its name, image, type(s), and some basic stats (such as HP, Attack, Defense, etc.) will be displayed.
